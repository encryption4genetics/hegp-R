\description{
Perform a standard genome wide association analysis. Used to check that plaintext and ciphertext data produce the same gwas results.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
basic.gwas( D, mc.cores=10 )
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{D}{A Dataset, as generated by \code{\link{build.D}} or \code{\link{encrypt.D}}}
  \item{mc.cores}{Number of cores for parellelisation}
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
\details{
Each vector of SNP dosages is tested for assocation with the phenotype by simple linear regression (i.e. no mixed model).
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{A dataframe containing the logP of each tested SNP joined to the columns of D$map}
%%  ~Describe the value returned
