\arguments{

  \item{D}{A Dataset to be encrypted, generateed by \code{\link{build.D}}}
  \item{encrypter}{An encrypter as generated by \code{\link{make.encrypter}}}
  \item{invert}{Decrypt the data by using the inverse encrypter (matrix transpose)}
  \item{kinship}{An optional Boolean switch, which if TRUE will create an encrypted kinship matrix of dimension \eqn{N \times N}, where \eqn{N} is the number of individuals.}

\value{
An encrypted (ciphertext) or decrypted (plaintext) Dataset derived from the input data by applying thee encryptor to it

\note{
%%  ~~further notes~~
The kinship (genetic relationship) matrix is defined as \eqn{K=GG^T/p} where \eqn{G} is the standardised matrix of SNP genotype dosages and \eqn{p} the number of SNPs. The function \code{make.kinship} in the package mixed.model.gwas is used for this purpose.
